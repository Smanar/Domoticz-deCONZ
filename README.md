# deCONZ bridge, a Zigbee plugin for Domoticz.   
It's a python plugin for Domoticz (home automation application).   
It uses the deCONZ REST API to make a bridge beetween your zigbee network and Domoticz using a Dresden Elektronik gateway and their application.   

## Description
To resume:
- you need a Dresden Elektronik gateway, a Raspbee (for raspberry) or Conbee (USB key), it support a lot of Zigbee devices, Xiaomi, Heiman, Ikea, Philips, Osram, Tuya, ect ....   
Official compatibility list https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/wiki/Supported-Devices

- You also need deCONZ (their application to control and set up ZigBee network). It can work with an headless mode but you can use their GUI, for maintenance, support, look at traffic, set attributes, manage router, use command like identify:

- You can use their Web app, for devices management, pairing, groups, scenes, events, ect ... https://phoscon.de/en/app/doc

- You can use too some android application like Hue essential compatible with deconz ... https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=7433470895643453779

- And use this plugin to bridge between the deCONZ server and domoticz. The plugin have now a Frontend for some actions (thx to @JayPearlman). To use it, just go in "Custom"/"DeCONZ".

## Requirement.
deCONZ : Last version.   
Domoticz : current stable version.   
Python : You need the requests library, if you have error message like "Module Import failed: ' Name: requests'", you probably miss it, to install it just type:
```
sudo -H pip3 install requests
sudo -H pip install requests
```

## Installation.
- With command line, go to your plugins directory (domoticz/plugins).   
- Run:   
```git clone https://github.com/Smanar/Domoticz-deCONZ.git```
- (If needed) Make the plugin.py file executable:   
```chmod +x Domoticz-deCONZ/plugin.py```
- Restart Domoticz.   
- Enable the plugin in hardware page (hardware page, select deconz plugin, click "update").   

You can later update the plugin
- With command line, go to the plugin directory (domoticz/plugin/Domoticz-deCONZ).   
- Run:   
```git pull```
- Restart Domoticz.    

To test the beta branch :
```
git pull
git checkout beta
git pull
```


## Configuration.
- The plugin works better with websocketnotifyall option set to true (it's the configuration by default).   
```curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X PUT -d '{"websocketnotifyall": true}' http://IP_DECONZ:80/api/API_KEY/config```
- The plugin doesn't use a special configuration file, except the banned.txt file.   
- At every start, it synchronises the deCONZ network with yours domoticz devices, so if you delete a device, at next startup, it will be re-created, so to prevent that, you can put the adress in the banned.txt file.   
- If you have problem to find your IP or the used port, take a look at https://phoscon.de/discover (Remember better to use 127.0.0.1 if domoticz and deconz are on the same machine).   
- Don't worry about the name, the plugin never updates name even you change it in deCONZ to prevent problems with scripts.   
- If you create a group, it's not possible to identify the type of device they are inside, so the type will be by defaut RGBWWZ to have all options, if you want to create only a dimmer group for exemple add "_dim" at the group name.   
- For those who have problems with API Key, there is a file called API_KEY.py to help you to create/delete/get list with command line, informations and commands inside the file. It can also give some information like your used websocket port. To show all commands or parameters just use:   
```
python3 API_KEY.py
``` 
If using default settings you might be able to obtain the API key using:
```
python3 API_KEY.py 127.0.0.1:80 create
```
And for those who don't know where to find the API key and don't wana use the tool: https://dresden-elektronik.github.io/deconz-rest-doc/getting_started/#acquire-an-api-key    
Or you can just use the Front End in Domoticz/Custom/Deconz.   

- By defaut the plugin use standard setting, you can use special one in the field "specials settings" on the hardware panel, available setting are :   

| Option 	| action |
|---	|---	|
| ENABLEMORESENSOR | enable tension and current sensors	|
| ENABLEBATTERYWIDGET	| create a  special widget by device just for battery |


## Remark.
- There is a deconz Discord channel https://discord.gg/QFhTxqN

- Take care if you have too many devices, at startup, the plugin adds ALL your devices from deCONZ in domoticz (except those who are in banned file).

- Finally, you can see more devices than you have in reality. This is normal, deCONZ can create more than 1 device for 1 real, and it can create for example 1 bulb + 2 switches just for 1 physical switch.

- If you haven't github acount, the support in domoticz forum is here https://www.domoticz.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=68&t=25631

- You can't use the native function in domoticz for switch (activation devices), because this plugin trigger device event for useless information, like battery level. So instead of using trigger event, you need to use button detected. You have some LUA examples here : [Use LUA for switch](https://github.com/Smanar/Domoticz-deCONZ/wiki/Examples-to-use-LUA-script-for-switch).   

- You have some others examples here :
>[Some LUA examples for sensors](https://github.com/Smanar/Domoticz-deCONZ/wiki/Examples-to-use-LUA-script-for-various-sensors).   
[Using LUA to change setting on the fly](https://github.com/Smanar/Domoticz-deCONZ/wiki/Examples-to-use-LUA-to-change-setting-on-the-fly.).   
[Create a color loop effect with zigbee bulb](https://github.com/Smanar/Domoticz-deCONZ/wiki/Example-to-make-a-color-loop-effect).   
[Mix temperature/humidity/barometer on the same sensor](https://github.com/Smanar/Domoticz-deCONZ/wiki/Example-to-make-a-LUA-script-to-mix-temperature-humidity-barometer-on-the-same-sensor).   

## Known issues.
- Don't take care about the error message   
```Error: (deCONZ): Socket Shutdown Error: 9, Bad file descriptor```   
I know where is the problem the problem, but I haven't find a way to avoid it, But it change nothing on working mode.

- If you add devices or change devices name for example in Phoscon after the plugin have started, the plugin will de desynchronized, and you will have this kind of error message   
```2018-12-29 20:49:32.807 Error: (deConz) Unknow MAJ{'name': 'TRÃ…DFRI Motion sensor', 'uniqueid': '00:0b:57:ff:xx:xx:xx:xx', 'id': '2', 'r': 'sensors', 't': 'event', 'e': 'changed'}```   
or   
```2018-12-29 20:54:04.979 (deConz) Banned device > 2 (sensors)```   
To solve them, no need to reboot, just restart the plugin, it synchronises at every start.
To restart plugin : Tab "Hardware" > select the hardware "deCONZ" then click "Update"   
- If your system doesn't support python "Request" lib, you can try older version < 1.0.9.
